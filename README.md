# Wilder World Community Led Events: Blockchain Coding

Throughout this course we will be mostly using python/jupyter notebook.

## Python environment

To download a python environment, head to https://www.anaconda.com/download#Downloads 

Once installed, you should be able to enter the Start Menu, type **Anaconda** and see the Anaconda Prompt:

Add this as a shortcut as we'll be using this a lot.

## Git

If you don't already have a git client installed, try https://tortoisegit.org/download/ 

Then go to https://github.com/tomdickharryeth/ww-blockchain-dev and paste the link that you see in Code

and use this to clone the git repo into a local folder of your choice.

Here's an example of doing this with tortoisegit.

Remember your git path as you'll need it later.

## Open up the Anaconda prompt and install python dependencies

Now we need to install the web3 python library as we'll be using this heavily. In the Anaconda prompt type

**pip install web3**
**pip install moralis**

## Move to your ww-blockchain-dev folder and launch Jupyter Notebook

Still in the Anaconda prompt, change to the ww-blockchain-dev directory that you cloned with git earlier, and then type

**jupyter-notebook**

You will see something like this:

and after a few seconds a new browser window show open up looking like this
