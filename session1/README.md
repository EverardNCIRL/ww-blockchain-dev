## Create a .env file in the ww-blockchain-dev directory
To avoid putting api keys on github where they can be read, you can create a .env file in the session1 folder.
Put your api keys in there, in the format:

``ETHERSCAN_API=(your key)``<br>
``ALCHEMY_API==(your key)``<br>
``MORALIS_API==(your key)``<br>

.env files are ignored by default by git (i.e. they are there by default in .gitignore) so they will not be committed to your git branch.
