# Wilder World Community Led Events: Blockchain Coding

##Lesson 4 : Mini Challenge

Use what you learned in Session 1 to claim testnet tokens from the Whipz sale contract which we saw in Session 3

You will need to copy and paste some of the code from there into the notebook (or somewhere else if you prefer)

Make sure you create a new wallet using Metamask since we will be handling the private key in code

There is one new thing we are learning this week: how to interact with a contract. You will see the code example below, you will need to integrate this with the code you write
