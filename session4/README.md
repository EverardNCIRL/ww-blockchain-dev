# Wilder World Community Led Events: Blockchain Coding

## Lesson 4 : Mini Challenge

Use what you learned in Sessions 1 and 3, to claim testnet tokens from the Whipz sale contract which we saw in Session 3.

Once you have done so, DM me on Discord or Twitter with the wallet address that you used. The first three people to claim Whipz from the contract will get 100 Discord XP!

Make sure you create a new wallet using Metamask since we will be handling the private key in code

Remember: You don't need to run the code in the sections "Give the TokenSale contract approval to spend Whipz" or "Mint Whipz to TokenSale address", since only the Whipz owner can do that. You just need to "Purchase Whipz from the TokenSale" which anyone can do.

As a quick reminder, there is some code in this session's notebook on how to interact with a contract (you can also look back at the Session 3 code directly).
